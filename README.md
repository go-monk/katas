Katas is a simple CLI tool to track your programming training. It's pretty low tech.

```
# Install and initialize.
$ go install github.com/go-monk/katas@latest
$ katas -init

# Select a kata. First, just copy it and meditate on it. Later, 
# rewrite the code from memory. Mark it as done. Repeat tomorrow.
$ katas
$ katas -done hello
```
